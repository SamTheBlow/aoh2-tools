I named it "tools" with an "s", but currently there is only one tool: this app allows you to fix the "zero relations bug" in any AOH2 save file.

Note: whenever you perform an operation on a game save, a new backup of the game save is automatically created just in case. If you use this tool a lot, make sure to clean up the backups folder from time to time, otherwise they will take a lot of space on your computer.
